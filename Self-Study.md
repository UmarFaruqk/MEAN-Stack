# Things I Learnt During The Course Of This Project
1. Open System Interconnectiom (OSI) model: is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols.
It is seen as a universal language for computer networking. It is based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.
It has seven layers namely;
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer 
5. Sessio Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer 
    Each layer of the OSI Model handles a specific job and communicates with the layers above and below itself.

2. Load Balancing: A load balancer is a software or hardware device that keeps any one server from becoming overloaded. A load balancing algorithm is the logic that a load balancer uses to distribute network traffic between servers (an algorithm is a set of predefined rules).
3. The Types are:
4. Dynamic and Static Load Balancing Algorithm
=> Dynamic: Least connection: Checks which servers have the fewest connections open at the time and sends traffic to those servers. This assumes all connections require roughly equal processing power.
Weighted least connection: Gives administrators the ability to assign different weights to each server, assuming that some servers can handle more connections than others.
=> Static: Round robin: Round robin load balancing distributes traffic to a list of servers in rotation using the Domain Name System (DNS). An authoritative nameserver will have a list of different A records for a domain and provides a different one in response to each DNS query.
Weighted round robin: Allows an administrator to assign different weights to each server. Servers deemed able to handle more traffic will receive slightly more. Weighting can be configured within DNS records.

# Obstacle Faced
During the course of thia project the only obstacle I had was with installing MongoDB but I was able to overcome it quickly going through stack overflow

# Lessons Learnt 
I learnt how to implement a simple Book Register web form using MEAN stack.
